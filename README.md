This application features token-based authentication, data from the popular API-as-a-service "newsapi.org", and private data storage on a custom built ExpressJS server (view the repository [here](https://github.com/ddemosi/news-explorer-api)). It also features a "sorting" method that will analyze the cards you've searched/saved into your account and rank them based on the most popular keywords. You can view this feature after signing up and saving some news articles into your account.
