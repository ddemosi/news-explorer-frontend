## News-Explorer project REACT.JS FUNCTIONALITY

Bootstrapped with Create-React-App

A few notes:

* Everything seems to be working. Depending on the speed of the api, sometimes the redirects are kind of funky
* Code is logically organized, but currently still pretty messy.
* Definitely still some refactoring needing to be done at a later day.

### Enjoy!
