## News-Explorer project FRONTEND HTML/CSS

Bootstrapped with Create-React-App

A few notes:

* There's a little bit of ReactJS logic, exclusively for conditional rendering and toggling modals. Not functional.
* Validation is working but not perfect. Haven't figured out how to do conditional onChange handling.
* Working on simplifying the styles. Learned some new tips and tricks, so that's fun.

### Enjoy!
