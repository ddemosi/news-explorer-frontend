## News-Explorer project FRONTEND HTML/CSS

Bootstrapped with Create-React-App

A few notes:

* There's a little bit of ReactJS logic, exclusively for conditional rendering and toggling modals. Not functional.
* Validation is working but not perfect. Haven't figured out how to do conditional onChange handling.
* Working on simplifying the styles. Learned some new tips and tricks, so that's fun.

Draft 2!

* Miscellaneous markup fixes, including navigation bar spacing, mobile menu changes, etc
* Forgot to add preloader. Preloader and Nothing Found blocks can now be viewed by clicking the "Search" button. There is currently a 3 second timeout trigger.
* Fixed popup opening/closing issues when using the navbar. 
* Inputs now highlight when in focus.
* Fixed button interactive styles.

### Enjoy!
