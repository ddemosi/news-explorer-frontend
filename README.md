## News-Explorer project REACT.JS FUNCTIONALITY

Bootstrapped with Create-React-App

A few notes:

* Everything seems to be working. Depending on the speed of the api, sometimes the redirects are kind of funky
* Code is logically organized, but currently still pretty messy.
* Couldn't get the redirect to work with the useHistory hook, so I used the useLocation hook instead.
* Created a crash function as part of the App.js, in case the api server fails.

### Enjoy!
